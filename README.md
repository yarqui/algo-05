# Substring Search Algorithm Benchmark

This project compares the performance of three classical substring search algorithms:

- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)**
- **Boyer-Moore**
- **Rabin-Karp**

Each algorithm is tested on two input files (`article 1.txt` and `article 2.txt`), using both a **present substring** (which exists in the file) and an **absent substring** (which does not exist in the file).

## Conclusions

- **Boyer-Moore consistently outperforms the other algorithms** for both present and absent substring cases, due to its efficient use of character skipping via its bad character heuristic.
- **KMP performs reasonably well**, especially on medium-sized texts, and offers consistent linear-time performance regardless of pattern content.
- **Rabin-Karp is the slowest** in this comparison, especially when the substring is not found. This is because its hashing approach still requires character-by-character comparisons after hash matches and is sensitive to collisions.
- **Absent substrings** increase execution time across all algorithms, as the search must scan more of the text.

---

## Takeaway

Although all three algorithms are theoretically efficient, **Boyer-Moore** is practically the best choice for most substring search tasks in large texts, especially when frequent mismatches are expected.
